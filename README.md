### Background Image
if you are going to have a background image, your CSS should look like this:
``` css
.sky {
  background-color: skyblue;
  background-image: url(../images/border.png);
  position: absolute;
  margin: 60px 0 0 0;
  width: 40%;
}
```




I, Rebecca Cohen, have read the point deduction list and understand that I will lose points for missing items.
